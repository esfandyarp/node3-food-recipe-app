# Introduction

This application was created in order to make accessing recipes easy.  Ideally, it will run on a device in the kitchen that the user can use to access recpies very quickly.  Recpies are stored in PDF format in /public/pdfs directory.

# Installation 

```
npm install
node app.js
```

Access application on []: http://localhost:3000

# Currently Working On

- Integrate search capability to filter through list of recipes.
- When uploading, user can upload any file type.  Will change to only allow PDF.
- Clean up upload success/fail dialog.
- Decide wether to continue using boostrap for styling or bake one from scratch.
