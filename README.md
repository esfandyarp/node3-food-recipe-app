# Introduction

This application was created in order to make accessing recipes easy.  Ideally, it will run on a device in the kitchen that the user can use to access recpies very quickly.  Recpies are stored in PDF format to allow for ease of access (and full content search down the line).

Documentation is currently being worked on.  Coming soon.
